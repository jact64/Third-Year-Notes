\subsection{Motivation}
More or less we want to use computers to calculate
\begin{align*}
  Ax &= B && A \inset{R}[m][n],\ x \inset{R}[n][1],\ B \inset {R}[m][1]
\end{align*}
When we have \textit{"A big-ass m"} i.e. m is $10^{5}$ this is hard to solve by hand. Additionally this course is useful for computational ODEs as they become matrices when solved computationally.\\
For data of populations we may be trying to find eigan values
\begin{align*}
  Av &= \lambda v && \text{for big } A
\end{align*}
The mastery part of this course is for M45 students and not for M3.
